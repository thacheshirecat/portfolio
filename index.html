      <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <img class ="alexpic" src="imgs/alex.jpg" alt="the face of the man">
      <p>I was born in the city of Alexandria, Virginia to Julia and Paul Bunnell.
        My earliest years were spent in Alexandria and then in the city of Herdon.
        By the age of six, my mother and I had moved back to Alexandria into a
        town home that my grandparents had invested in back in the 70s. I attended
        private middle and elementary school as my mother was adament that a good
        education was one of the keys to success in life. I was always held to a
        high academic standard and was eventually accepted to a private high-school
        in Washington D.C. not far from where we were living. However, while the
        education was excellent I never quite fit into the culture of the school.
        I did take two computer science classes in highschool, both focusing on
        Java, however in the end I decided to pursue philosophy in college as at
        the age of 18 I really did not know what I wanted to do with my life.
