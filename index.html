        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <img class ="alexpic" src="imgs/alex.jpg" alt="the face of the man">
        <p>I was born in the city of Alexandria, Virginia to Julia and Paul Bunnell.
          My earliest years were spent in Alexandria and then in the city of Herdon.
          By the age of six, my mother and I had moved back to Alexandria into a
          town home that my grandparents had invested in back in the 70s. I attended
          private middle and elementary school as my mother was adament that a good
          education was one of the keys to success in life. I was always held to a
          high academic standard and was eventually accepted to a private high-school
          in Washington D.C. not far from where we were living. However, while the
          education was excellent I never quite fit into the culture of the school.
          I did take two computer science classes in highschool, both focusing on
          Java, however in the end I decided to pursue philosophy in college as at
          the age of 18 I really did not know what I wanted to do with my life.
        </p>

          <h3>Current Interests</h3>
            <p>I, like many others around my age that grew up in the U.S., grew
              fond of video games at a young age (purchased first console, SNES, at
              the age of 7). I enjoy being able to explore new worlds and take part
              in stories too fantastical for real life, as well as optimizing and
              theorycrafting. For many years I wanted to be a video game developer,
              however always felt that this was not something that people would take
              seriously, and also recognized the various sterotypes surrounding
              gamers with no coding/project experience wanting to be game devs. Over
              time, and after moving to Seattle, I interacted with more people who
              had the same dream, but who had followed it through to the end. These
              interactions, along with whatever wisdom I acquired as I grew older,
              finally convinced me that I needed to take a step, even if it wasn't
              directly towards the end of being a game dev. I may never become an
              actual game developer, however coding, gaming and creativity will
              always be a part of my life.
            </p>
            <p>Below is a list of some of my favorite games:
            </p>
            <ul class="videogames">
              <li>Warcraft Franchise/World of Warcraft (currently inactive)</li>
              <li>Elder Scrolls Franchise/Elder Scrolls Online (active player)</li>
              <li>Starcraft/Starcraft II</li>
              <li>Path of Exile</li>
              <li>Diablo Franchise</li>
              <li>Bioshock (original)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But I don't spend all my free time immersed in fantasy, my other
              interests include:
